[Decode Me](https://quel-hacker-es-tu.defense.gouv.fr/challenges/dicod/decode-me/) was one of the challenge proposed
during the one-month CTF organized by [@ComCyberFR](https://twitter.com/ComcyberFR). 
This challenge was a reverse challenge. You have a binary which expects a password:

```bash
$ ./decode-me 
./decode-me <password>
$ ./decode-me test
Bad password
```

So let's start the reverse!

# Static analysis - first service

Before starting reading the assembly, some basic analysis. 

```bash
$ file decode-me
decode-me: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=68d67f11189e9759d9b07e7de74d85690d3390b2, not stripped
```

The file is stripped. This will make the reverse a little bit harder as no debug information is present.
Also, the file is statically linked. Which means that it would contains a lot of useless functions.
We should also check if the file is packed:

![Entropy from DIE](/images/2020-07-29-200011_die.png){:class="img-responsive"}

The file doesn't seem to be packed either. Ok, time to look at some binary. 

# Static analysis - second service

I used [GHydra](https://ghidra-sre.org/)
for the reverse. The entrypoint is:

```C
void _start(void) {
  __libc_start_main(main);
  do {
                    /* WARNING: Do nothing block with infinite loop */
  } while( true );
}
```

Nothing special here. And the function **main**:
```C
void main(void){
  code *pcVar1;
  
  args = &stack0x00000004;
  signal(5,authentification);
  pcVar1 = (code *)swi(3);
  (*pcVar1)();
  return;
}
```

Ah! An anti-debugging technique! Here, the principle is to throw an INT3, which is a signal SIGTRAP. When a debugger
reads this, it stops its execution. However, we can notice that the program set a signal. 5 is associated to SIGTRAP
(you can find the list of signals in the file **signal.h**). Normally, the program will throw a SIGTRAP and call the 
function **authentication**. The debugger will overide the behavior. [More information here (in french)](https://bases-hacking.org/faux-breakpoint.html).

Let's check the authentication function. 

```C
void authentification(void) {
  undefined4 *puVar1;
  short sVar2;
  long lVar3;
  
  puVar1 = (undefined4 *)args[1];
  if (*args != 2) {
    printf("%s <password>\n",*puVar1);
    exit(1);
  }
  lVar3 = ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME,0,1,0);
  if (lVar3 == -1) {
    puts("Checking password..");
    check_password2(*puVar1);
    puts("Bad password");
  }
  else {
    sVar2 = check_password(puVar1[1]);
    if (sVar2 == 0) {
      puts("Bad password");
    }
    else {
      puts("Good Job, you can validate with this password =)");
    }
  }
  exit(0);
}
```

Here again, another anti-debugging technic. The program is calling `ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME,0,1,0)` on itself.
If a debugger is present, the function will return -1, 0 otherwise. It is another way to prevent dynamic analysis.
You can easily confirm that because the result of `check_password2` is ignored and the program always prints 
"Bad password"! 

# Static analysis - final plate

Time to analyze real checking function `check_password`. The next snippet is a clean version of this function:

```C
uint check_password(char *password) {
  password_length = strlen(password);
  MAX_LENGTH = 96;
  
  local_3d = 0xf394b8b8;
  local_39 = 0x9dabd7af;
  local_35 = 0x593299a8;
  local_31 = 0x1f20d82f;
  local_2d = 0xceb6f6b0;
  local_29 = 0xc92774cc;
  local_25 = 0x5955f0e0;
  local_21 = 0xcc26908d;
  local_1d = 0xe6b5ab5e;
  local_19 = 0x529cef69;
  local_15 = 0x4e8d5d5;
  local_11 = 0;
  real_password = *local_3d;
  real_password_length = 45;

  if (password_length < MAX_LENGTH) {
    gen_tab(password); // Randomly fill the variable array
    next_function = /* calculate a value /;
    int i = 0;
    while(i < password_length) {
      char c = array[i];
      encrypted_password[i] = funcs[next_function](c);
      // next doesn't exist in the binary, 
      // Just to make the code cleaner
      next_function = next(next_function, encrypted_password[i]);
      i++;
    }
    int j = 0;
    int result = 1;
    while(j < real_password_length - 1) {
      if(real_password[j] != encrypted_password[j]) {
	result = 0;
      }
      j++;
    }
    return result;
  }
  ...
}
```

So, **local_3d** contains the encrypted password. The next snippet is a short version of **gen_tab**:

```C
void gen_tab(char *password) {
  ...
  hash = 0;
  password_length = strlen(password);
  i = 0;
  while (i < password_length) {
    hash += (int)password[i];
    i += 1;
  }
  srandom(hash & 0x3ff);
  j = 0;
  while (j < 96) {
    random_char = rand();
    ascii[j] = (char)random_char;
    j += 1;
  }
}
```

The function randomly fills an array. Well, not so randomly. The seed is generated from a hash calculated from 
the password. We might think that there is a huge number of possibility. But, we can see that the hash is 
*"anded"* with 0x3FF or 1023. Which means that there will be no more than 1024 ways of filling the ascii array!

Let's get back to **check_password**. The variable **next_function** is used with the array **funcs**.
**funcs** is an array of 4 functions to decode. So, the first initialization of **next_function** is 0, 1, 2 or 3.

In fact, there will be no more than 4096 passwords possibles. We can easily generate all combinaisons of 
(`next_function`, `array`) then called **decode-me** until we get the message **Good job**!

# Decoding it

So, to decode the password, I wrote a program to generate all 1024 values of array **ascii**:

```C
void main() {
  for( int hash = 0; hash < 1024; hash++){
    long lVar1;
    srandom(hash & 0x3ff);
    int j = 0;
    while (j < 0x60) {
      int lVar1 = rand();
      char c = (char)(lVar1 & 0xFF);
      printf("%02X", (unsigned int)(lVar1 & 0xFF));
      j += 1;
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}
```

Then, I wrote a python script which, for an array **ascii**, it generates 4 passwords. The next snippet is the 
simplified algorithm of the script

```
For i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:
  next_function = i
  For c in local_3d:
    r = reverse_functions[next_function](c)
    print(r)
    next_function = next(next_function, r)
```

The main job was to:
 
 - Find the reverse function for each encoding functions of array **funcs**
 - Write a correct implementation of function **next**

To do so, I needed to do some dynamic analysis

# Dynamic analysis - the dessert!

Here, nothing special in fact. I have to bypass anti-debugging protections.
One solution could have been to modify the binary and execute in gdb.
I found it simplier just to add breakpoints before the execution of anti-debugging commands and 
directly jumps to the next correct line.

Once done, I retrieved some values from the program and check that reversed functions return the correct value.

# The digestif!

Time to get the password!

```bash
$ gcc decode-me.c
$ ./a.out > decode-me.ascii # generate all 1024 random values of ascii
$ python3 decode-me.py > decode-me.res
$ $ for i in $(cat decode-me.res); do ./decode-me $i | grep Good && echo $i ; done
Good Job, you can validate with this password =)

That's all floks!
